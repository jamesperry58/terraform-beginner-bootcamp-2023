Changed file name to Getting Started

Getting Started with GitHub and Gitpod

I already have a GitHub account, no need to create one.
I followed the steps to clone the terraform-beginner-bootcamp-2023
To open and view files in GitHub, you can follow these steps:
Go to the GitHub repository that contains the file you want to view.
Click the file name in the list of files.
The file will open in a new tab.
You can view the file content, as well as the revision history, by clicking the different tabs at the top of the page.

#**To integrate Gitpod with GitHub, follow these steps:**#

Go to the Gitpod website and create an account.
Click the "Connect GitHub" button and authorize Gitpod to access your GitHub account.
Once your accounts are connected, you can start a Gitpod workspace for any of your GitHub repositories by clicking the "Open in Gitpod" button next to the repository.
Gitpod will create a new workspace for you and open it in your browser. You can then start coding in your repository using the built-in IDE.

You can also install the Gitpod browser extension to make it even easier to start Gitpod workspaces. Once the extension is installed, you will see a green "Gitpod" button on every GitHub repository page. Clicking the button will start a Gitpod workspace for the repository.

#**GitHub Flavored Markdown GFM**#

We'll be using GFM to document changes, issues, and errors for this bootcamp project.

#**GFM Basics**#

Use headings to structure your content. To create a heading, start a line with one to six hash symbols (#). The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading. For example, a single hash symbol (#) creates a level 1 heading, two hash symbols (##) create a level 2 heading, and so on.
Use paragraphs and line breaks to format your text. To create a paragraph, simply start a new line. To create a line break, press Enter twice.
Use bold, italics, and strikethrough to emphasize your text. To make text bold, enclose it in two asterisks (**) or underscores (__). To make text italic, enclose it in one asterisk (*) or underscore (_). To strikethrough text, enclose it in two tildes (~).

#**To create a list in GFM, you can use either ordered or unordered lists**#

###Ordered lists###
Ordered lists are numbered lists, and they are created by prefixing each list item with a number and a period (.). For example, the following Markdown code would create an ordered list:
1. First item in the list
2. Second item in the list
3. Third item in the list

###Unordered lists####
Unordered lists are bulleted lists, and they are created by prefixing each list item with an asterisk (*) or a hyphen (-). For example, the following Markdown code would create an unordered list:
* First item in the list
* Second item in the list
* Third item in the list

 ##**Use links to other resources**##

 To create a link, enclose the text of the link in square brackets ([]), followed by the URL of the resource in parentheses ().
Use code blocks to format code. To create a code block, start a line with three backticks (). Then, paste your code into the code block. To end the code block, type three backticks () again.
Apply syntax codeblock Highlighting: use the code name in the top before the code.
